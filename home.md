# Sméagol

Welcome to Sméagol, the personal wiki of [Sam Whited](https://samwhited.com).

This wiki is running on [Github's](https://github.com/github) [Gollum](https://github.com/github/gollum). Despite the name, it is not using the [Smeagol](https://github.com/rubyworks/smeagol) gem; instead it is using some custom Rack middlware that does nothing more than perform basic authentication.
